Privacy Policy for The Daily Grid App
Last updated: November 28, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how The Daily Grid App ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This App is designed to be privacy-first, storing your data locally on your device or securely in your personal iCloud account.

Information We Collect
1. Personal Data
We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on our own servers. We do not require you to create an account with us to use the App.

2. Usage Data
The App stores your tasks, completion history, and preferences locally on your device.

How We Store Your Data
Local Storage
All data you create within the App (tasks, streaks, settings) is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage technologies (UserDefaults and file system).

iCloud Sync (Optional)
If you choose to enable iCloud synchronization, your data will be stored in your personal iCloud container. This data is encrypted by Apple and is only accessible by you across your devices signed in with the same Apple ID. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

Third-Party Services
Apple Services
The App uses Apple's services for core functionality, including:

iCloud: For data synchronization (if enabled).
UserNotifications: To send you local reminders for your tasks.
Please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle your data.

Data Retention and Deletion
Since your data is stored locally or in your iCloud account:

Retention: Data is retained as long as you have the App installed or until you delete it.
Deletion: You can delete your data at any time by deleting the App from your device. You can also delete specific data (like tasks) directly within the App's interface.
Children's Privacy
Our App does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal data, this applies to all users.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
